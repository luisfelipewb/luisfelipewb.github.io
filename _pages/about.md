Like most computer engineers, Iâ€™ve always been interested in knowing how things work. This curiosity led to many disassembled and broken devices during my childhood. Against the nerd stereotype, I love outdoor adventures. Spend a few days out into the wild with nothing but your backpack? Count me in!

After graduation, most of my professional experience was in the telecommunication industry, where I worked for 7 years. I had the chance to work on cool projects, meet great people, and even live on the opposite side of the globe.

During a vacation trip in 2019, troubled by the sheer amount of garbage on a paradisiacal beach, the thought of autonomous robots collecting trash came quickly to my mind. Since then, I committed my free time to improve my technical skills and learn how to program robots.

In 2020 I started the <a href='https://omscs.gatech.edu/'> OMSCS program</a> pursuing the Computation Perception and Robotics specialization. One year later, I decided to go all-in. I resigned from my job and moved to France to finish the MSCS program at <a href='https://lorraine.gatech.edu/'>GeorgiaTech Lorraine</a>. Working closely with the <a href='https://dream.georgiatech-metz.fr/'> DREAM lab</a>, I hope to develop the skills needed to build autonomous robots that can assist in the preservation and recovery of the natural environment.
